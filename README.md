## How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node and EJS

I built the character's status information using the public Fate Grand Order API database.  Using ejs with javascript, I used loops to automatically display all the html for the gameplay web page and the photo web page.  Utilizing Node.js and the framework Express, I built the backend code to host the server for the website and send input submissions to the respective MongoDB database.  For the hamburger menu and the ruby menu, I used javascript logic to make them function the intended way, as well as the carousel in other web page.

## Lessons Learned:

Using Media Queries, I was able to enable zooming in and out to make the website function properly without letting the website layout and content break, while also making the text more readable and the images look more visible.

## Examples:
